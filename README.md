## Info

I have been able to learn more and implement:

* Database Relationships
* Class Bases Views
* User Authentification and permissions
* Django Signals
* Password reset email sending
* PostgreSQL with **AWS**
* **S3 Buckets** to store static and media
* Integrating Heroku with the **postreSQL** DB

**Bugs:**               
After messing with postgreSQL, S3 Buckets and deploying I started having some bugs with showing profile pics, and decided to keep ok working other projects, keep learning and come back after a while to solve these more efficiently.
Due to this and some SQL issues I decided to **deploy** branch **"Part-21"** wich was prior to adding them, but all the code on later branches can be seen.
              
           
## Technologies

For this project, I used **Django**, **AWS**, **S3 Buckets** and **PostgreSQL**, among other more basic skills.                  
I deployed it on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and made it work in combination with **AWS**.
               
               
                 
## Motivation

I was following a Youtube Tutorial, learning so many new things that I tried not to deviate too much from the original.
