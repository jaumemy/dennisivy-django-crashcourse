# dennisivy-django-crashcourse    

I built this **Customer Relationship Management** web app, or CRM, using Django and following [Dennis Iv's tutorial](https://github.com/divanov11/crash-course-CRM) , but customizing and adapting some parts.   

[Here](https://crm1app.herokuapp.com/) is the Live Server of it.


### During this time I learned more about:   

* Database Relationships
* Class Bases Views
* User Authentification and permissions
* Django Signals
* Password reset email sending
* PostgreSQL with **AWS**
* **S3 Buckets** to store static and media
* Integrating Heroku with the **postreSQL** DB.


 ### Bugs
 After messing with postgreSQL, S3 Buckets and deploying i started having some bugs with showing profile pics, and decided to keep ok working other projects, keep learning and come back after a while to solve these more efficiently.
